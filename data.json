When the paint peels and cracks, it makes lead dust. Children can be exposed to lead when they swallow or breathe in lead dust.\nWater pipes may contain lead.\n\nLead is sometimes in candies or traditional home remedies.\n\nCertain jobs and hobbies involve working with lead-based products, like stain glass work, and may cause parents to bring lead into the home.\n\nChildren who live near airports may be exposed to lead in air and soil from aviation gas used in piston engine aircrafts.\n\nRecent articles on lead\nLead in cinnamon \nHeavy metals in spices\nLead is in most printing inks\nLead is on the hands of everyone who handles guns ammunition and fishing weights\nLead is in cosmetics\n\n\nSome toys, especially those that are imported or are antique toys, and toy jewelry may contain lead.\n\nImported Toys. Toys made in other countries are more likely to contain lead than toys made in, for example, the United States, Canada, or the European Union.1 Lead paint was banned for use in house paint, on products marketed to children, and on dishes or cookware in the United States in 1978. However, it is still widely used in many other countries.\nAntique Toys. Toys made before the ban on lead paint in 1978 may contain lead-based paint. Therefore, painted antiques or collectible toys that are passed down through generations may contain lead. Additionally, older toys made of tin, brass, or pewter alloys may contain lead.\n\nJewelry. Lead is often used in jewelry, including children\u2019s jewelry, to make the product heavier, brighten colors, and stabilize or soften plastic.2,3,4 Jewelry labeled as made in the United States is less likely to contain lead compared with jewelry made abroad and purchased through informal and unregulated sources. Children should not be allowed to wear jewelry that may contain lead because of exposure from chewing, sucking on, or swallowing jewelry.\n\nPlastic Toys and Other Products. The use of lead in plastics has not been banned. Lead is used to soften plastic and to make it more flexible so that it can go back to its original shape. It may also be used in plastic toys to stabilize molecules from heat.5 When the plastic is exposed to sunlight, air, or detergents, the chemical bond between the lead and plastics breaks down and forms a dust. A young child may touch the plastic toy and then ingest the dust when putting their fingers in their mouth.\n\nLead is also used in making alloys with other elements such as antimony, tin, arsenic, and calcium that may be used in toys."}, {"id": 652, "question": "How is Reddit responding to the recent news that Woman\u2019s feet amputated after boyfriend allegedly shoves her in front of NYC train?", "answer": "Now we have videogames.

Evidence was collected from the crime scene. A suspect was brought in, and likely a warrant issued for hair samples. Those hair samples were taken, with ms. Woods doing the testing; comparing the suspects hair samples with the ones found at the crime scene. \n\nHer determination was that the hair matched, indicating the suspect was possibly the perpetrator, and that evidence was submitted to the prosecution to use in court.\nHowever, a secondary investigation (likely commissioned by the defense) found the hair samples found at the scene matched the VICTIM, not the suspect. Ms woods, on being confronted with this information, admitted her ego was bruised. The evidence was thus, properly, disallowed. \n\nHowever, 10 months later, another mysterious sample of hair was compared to the hair at the scene, and found that it DID match the suspect. The issue is there's no record that evidence was actually collected at the scene, thus opening the possibility Ms woods simply took a partial amount of the hair collected from the suspect as a part of the evidenciary subpoena, and tested it against hair collected from the exact same sampling. This then WAS submitted as evidence, used at trial, and used to help convict the suspect.\n\nIn hindsight, it's looking very possible that the evidence was completely & utterly falsified and presented as legitimate evidence of a crime.

It may be correct, but this and other evidence suggests the requirements for abiogenesis are all, or were, on Earth. Panspermia isn't really a very interesting subject since it just passes the buck on the Big Question.\n\nPanspermia is also about life being seeded from elsewhere, not just the raw components. The more earth-based abiogenesis theories still include materials from space, but are not panspermia."}, {"id": 1572, "question": "How is Reddit responding to the recent news that \u2018Monumental\u2019 experiment suggests how life on Earth may have started?", "answer": "you cant do things if you are outside  of time, time is literally required for change."}, {"id": 1573, "question": "How is Reddit responding to the recent news that \u2018Monumental\u2019 experiment suggests how life on Earth may have started?", "answer": "Wayfair has some weird ones called Saturn.

It was so triggering i couldn\u2019t make it through 1 episode. It\u2019s so infuriating to watch knowing not one person is in prison for what they did.

Insurance companies should be outraged. Unless they get kickbacks too. \n\nAnother feature is that as soon as one gets closed down they rebrand and reopen. This did not occur at the school highlighted. That's how abandoned records and recordings of YEARS of abuse became available to the public. So, no.
