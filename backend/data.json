Without the cooperation of the victim it's very hard to convict a domestic abuser because there's rarely any other evidence around.\n\nLet's say a guy beats his girlfriend half to death but she decides not to press charges. The state decides to pursue the case anyway. Without testimony for why the girlfriend looks the way she does it's very easy for even an inexperienced public defender to say that the girlfriend could have gotten those injuries any number of ways aside from being beaten. The state has its theories, the defendant has their own theories, that's not beyond reasonable doubt. The abuser will more likely than not end up going free, so pursuing a DV case without a cooperative victim is generally a waste of resources.\n\nIn this case the incident was almost certainly recorded and has multiple independant witnesses, so there's plenty of evidence to charge and convict this dude with or without the victim's testimony. Though I'd really hope that the lady will cooperate and help throw his ass in jail."}, {"id": 170, "question": "How is Reddit responding to the recent news that Woman\u2019s feet amputated after boyfriend allegedly shoves her in front of NYC train?", "answer": "They gotta stretch the billable hours."}, {"id": 171, "question": "How is Reddit responding to the recent news that Woman\u2019s feet amputated after boyfriend allegedly shoves her in front of NYC train?", "answer": "why didn't they just teleport to where he is"}, {"id": 172, "question": "How is Reddit responding to the recent news that Woman\u2019s feet amputated after boyfriend allegedly shoves her in front of NYC train?", "answer": "\"The\u00a0boyfriend\u00a0fled from the station after pushing her and was being sought, cops said\"\n\nhttps://nypost.com/2024/03/09/us-news/woman-hit-by-subway-feet-severed-after-boyfriend-push-cops/"}, {"id": 173, "question": "How is Reddit responding to the recent news that Woman\u2019s feet amputated after boyfriend allegedly shoves her in front of NYC train?", "answer": "Because this article was written right after it happened"}, {"id": 174, "question": "How is Reddit responding to the recent news that Woman\u2019s feet amputated after boyfriend allegedly shoves her in front of NYC train?", "answer": "What's to talk about?\n\nThe story was written before he could be located.

People (including drunk people) would regularly use it as a walking route between the two. This set of rails ran by two small manufacturer shops, and a scrap yard. As a teenager exploring these areas with friends, we'd often be wandering around after finding holes in the old fences. One time, it was way after hours, and we thought it would be fun to climb up onto the roof of one of those businesses. We dragged a dumpster over to the roof access ladder, and climbed up. When we got up there, there was already someone up there sleeping against once of the roof exhaust vents. Despite us not trying to be very quiet, he never woke up (but did move a couple of times, so we knew he wasn't dead).\n\n  \nHe must have been sneakier about getting up there, because our moving around that dumpster alerted an overnight security guard of our presence, and he called the cops who surrounded the building. They sent an officer up to find and collect us.

My dad had a really bad experience. One day he was driving from one appointment to another over the autobahn. When he got there he couldn\u2019t open the car door. He had to throw his entire bodyweight against the door until it finally opened. When he got out, he saw that his car was completely fucked on the sides.\n\nHe later told us that he had one of those blackouts from the point where he exited a tunnel to where he left the autobahn. That was a distance of several kilometers over a period of 10 to 15 minutes where he was on autopilot.\n\nThen the police got in contact and told him they got  calls from people who where driving behind him, telling them he was swerving across all lanes from the left to the right and back, smashing into the barrier and causing the damage to his car.\n\nI still don\u2019t understand why his license wasn\u2019t taken away right then and there.\n\nI know he went to a doctor and the word epilepsy was said but I\u2018m not sure if he ever got treatment because a couple of years later he totaled his car. Police said he e wasn\u2019t drunk so I suspect it was another blackout.\n\nAnd then another couple of years later I called him in the evening because we had something planed and he casually told me we had to reschedule because he was in a car accident the day before. Wtf dude?! Yes, he totaled another car. But luckily this time he was just completely wasted.\n\nWe\u2018re not on speaking terms because after that I realized he doesn\u2019t even try to change, is a danger to himself and the people around him and I don\u2019t need that in my life.

Evidence was collected from the crime scene. A suspect was brought in, and likely a warrant issued for hair samples. Those hair samples were taken, with ms. Woods doing the testing; comparing the suspects hair samples with the ones found at the crime scene. \n\nHer determination was that the hair matched, indicating the suspect was possibly the perpetrator, and that evidence was submitted to the prosecution to use in court.\nHowever, a secondary investigation (likely commissioned by the defense) found the hair samples found at the scene matched the VICTIM, not the suspect. Ms woods, on being confronted with this information, admitted her ego was bruised. The evidence was thus, properly, disallowed. \n\nHowever, 10 months later, another mysterious sample of hair was compared to the hair at the scene, and found that it DID match the suspect. The issue is there's no record that evidence was actually collected at the scene, thus opening the possibility Ms woods simply took a partial amount of the hair collected from the suspect as a part of the evidenciary subpoena, and tested it against hair collected from the exact same sampling. This then WAS submitted as evidence, used at trial, and used to help convict the suspect.\n\nIn hindsight, it's looking very possible that the evidence was completely & utterly falsified and presented as legitimate evidence of a crime.
