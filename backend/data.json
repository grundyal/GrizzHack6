A lot of sailers would restock and supplement supplies using turtle meat.\n\nQuotes from various articles about it:\n\n>The reason that the giant tortoise wasn\u2019t properly classified by scientists for so long appears to be quite simple: **they were so delicious that no specimens ever made it back to Europe without being eaten on the voyage.**\n\n>According to scores of accounts over several centuries, the giant tortoise is by far the most edible creature man has ever encountered. 16th-century explorers compared them to chicken, beef, mutton and butter \u2013 but only to say how much better the tortoise was. One tortoise would feed several men, and both its meat and its fat were perfectly digestible, no matter how much you ate.\n\n>Oil made from tortoise fat was medically useful \u2013 efficacious against colds, cramps, indigestion and all manner of \u2018distempers\u2019 \u2013 and tasted wonderful. Even better were the delicious liver, and the gorgeous bone marrow. The eggs, inevitably, were the best anyone had ever eaten. Some sailors were reluctant to try tortoise meat because the animal was so ugly - but after one taste they were converted.\n\n>Giant tortoises were invaluable to sailors, as they could be kept alive for at least six months without food or water. Stacked helplessly on their backs, they could be killed and eaten as and when necessary. Better still, they sucked up gallons of water at a time and kept it in a special bladder, meaning that a carefully butchered tortoise was also a fountain of cool, perfectly drinkable water. Large-scale commercial whaling in the 19th century was only made possible because the giant tortoises enabled ships to stay at sea for weeks at a time.\n\nand\n\n>US Navy captain David Porter declared [in 1815] \"after once tasting the Galapagos tortoises, every other animal food fell off greatly in our estimation ... \"\n\n>\"The meat of this animal is the easiest of digestion, and a quantity of it, exceeding that of any other food, can be eaten without experiencing the slightest of inconvenience.\"\n\n>Darwin was less enthusiastic about the meat, writing \"the breast-plate roasted (as the Gauchos do \"carne con cuero\"), with the flesh on it, is very good; and the young tortoises make excellent soup; but otherwise the meat to my taste is indifferent.\""}, {"id": 195, "question": "How is Reddit responding to the recent news that 9 dead, 78 others hospitalized after eating sea turtle meat on Zanzibar\u2019s Pemba Island?", "answer": "You've never heard of turtle soup?

Duh.\n\nIt exist as a way to get around geo blocking so you can watch content not in your region or area.\n\nFor example. What you want to watch isn't for Illinois but another state or city. Change location and now you can watch channels. Useful when the app goes by IP and GPS. So you change IP and give false gos coordinates. Like a proxy or vpn for example.\n\nThat's how you can sometimes watch out of a market area when they do that.\n\nMost likely they was on her street temporarily and left so they thought they could raid that house.\n\nSo the find my device app will only go by the coordinates that it sees and because you changed this. It sees the alternative coordinates.\n\nPlenty of gps faking apps. This stops phone apps from knowing true location when location is required for certain apps. Like i said this is intended to get around market area blocking where only people in Chicago can watch a stream for example.\n\nAnd that you can get around censorship of other countries when watching shows from another country.\n\nYou change ip then fake location too.

I mean, I don't think they're implying it NEVER happened before recently, but it does seem to be an increasing issue over time with gun violence.   \nPeople like to demonize AR15's for their use in shootings, but AR15's were around for 40 years before one was used in a mass shooting.   \n  \nIn rural areas of the US, kids used to ride their bikes to school with a rifle across the handlebars, they could bring the rifle into school, have the principal lock it up for them, and get it back so they could go hunting after school. School shootings were extremely rare at that time.

Kids are impulsive. Easy access to guns in the home is horrifically dangerous in these situations - ease of access, familiarity with the method, and lethality of method all increasing suicide rates. The book Children Under Fire goes into this. The author cites a survey of teenagers and young adults who survived suicide attempts which found a quarter of them attempted suicide within five minutes of deciding to, which means if a kid is going for a gun rather than pills, cutting etc they are far more likely to die. \n\nInterestingly, the book also discusses a survey of gun owning families in the rural Southern US which found children knew far more about the guns their parents owned than the parents believed (akin to how parents usually think their kids know far less about sex than they do). In the case of 40% of parents who said their kids don't know where they store their guns, the kids said they knew. Parents believed their children had never handled their guns, the kids said they had. And children educated about gun safety were just as likely to say they'd played with the weapons. \n\nIt's terribly sad to think of kids impulsively ending their own lives with unlocked, loaded firearms on their homes, and gun advocates saying  of suicides in general \"oh well, they would just use some other method\" (not true)."}, {"id": 809, "question": "How is Reddit responding to the recent news that Woman\u2019s feet amputated after boyfriend allegedly shoves her in front of NYC train?", "answer": "> giving\n\nWho's giving?

When we got up there, there was already someone up there sleeping against once of the roof exhaust vents. Despite us not trying to be very quiet, he never woke up (but did move a couple of times, so we knew he wasn't dead).\n\n  \nHe must have been sneakier about getting up there, because our moving around that dumpster alerted an overnight security guard of our presence, and he called the cops who surrounded the building.

You'd try to get away with it.  That's the point.  A bad wicked person -- not the guy you're replying to, just a *hypothetical* bad guy -- would not suddenly unlock the crate, let her out, admit to authorities \"I locked her in, then heard her and unlocked her.\"  That kind of thing is what a *good* person would do.\n\nSo the person you're replying to is suggesting that since the storage crate owner voluntarily let her out and admitted his actions readily/easily/honestly, it seems pretty clear he's *not* the hypothetical bad person we're suggesting.

He had to throw his entire bodyweight against the door until it finally opened. When he got out, he saw that his car was completely fucked on the sides.\n\nHe later told us that he had one of those blackouts from the point where he exited a tunnel to where he left the autobahn. That was a distance of several kilometers over a period of 10 to 15 minutes where he was on autopilot.\n\nThen the police got in contact and told him they got  calls from people who where driving behind him, telling them he was swerving across all lanes from the left to the right and back, smashing into the barrier and causing the damage to his car.\n\nI still don\u2019t understand why his license wasn\u2019t taken away right then and there.\n\nI know he went to a doctor and the word epilepsy was said but I\u2018m not sure if he ever got treatment because a couple of years later he totaled his car. Police said he e wasn\u2019t drunk so I suspect it was another blackout.\n\nAnd then another couple of years later I called him in the evening because we had something planed and he casually told me we had to reschedule because he was in a car accident the day before. Wtf dude?! Yes, he totaled another car. But luckily this time he was just completely wasted.\n\nWe\u2018re not on speaking terms because after that I realized he doesn\u2019t even try to change, is a danger to himself and the people around him and I don\u2019t need that in my life.

Woods doing the testing; comparing the suspects hair samples with the ones found at the crime scene. \n\nHer determination was that the hair matched, indicating the suspect was possibly the perpetrator, and that evidence was submitted to the prosecution to use in court.\nHowever, a secondary investigation (likely commissioned by the defense) found the hair samples found at the scene matched the VICTIM, not the suspect. Ms woods, on being confronted with this information, admitted her ego was bruised. The evidence was thus, properly, disallowed. \n\nHowever, 10 months later, another mysterious sample of hair was compared to the hair at the scene, and found that it DID match the suspect. The issue is there's no record that evidence was actually collected at the scene, thus opening the possibility Ms woods simply took a partial amount of the hair collected from the suspect as a part of the evidenciary subpoena, and tested it against hair collected from the exact same sampling. This then WAS submitted as evidence, used at trial, and used to help convict the suspect.\n\nIn hindsight, it's looking very possible that the evidence was completely & utterly falsified and presented as legitimate evidence of a crime.

In that universe, what\u2019s the harm in letting people think your secret tech is a UFO?\n\n\nThe only reasoning I can come up with, is that the whole thing spurred the Schumer-Rounds amendment (which was unfortunately gutted) so they see the UAP push to be a threat against whatever the fuck it is the military is improperly hiding from Congress. \n\n\n\n\nAll this is to say, that we need that legislation to pass at some point so Congress can have proper oversight over these issues and we can stop being jerked around regularly by these *reports* whose only real function is to get the headline the Pentagon is after."}, {"id": 1803, "question": "How is Reddit responding to the recent news that Pentagon UFO report says most sightings 'ordinary objects' and phenomena?", "answer": "Just head over to r/ufo to see this in action.

By thoroughly analyzing decades of U.S. government data and reports, and finding no credible evidence linking UFO sightings to extraterrestrial technology or visitations, the study aligns with the scientific consensus so far.\n\nThat said, I don't think this definitively settles the entire UFO/UAP issue. A few thoughts:\n\n1. The study appears to have focused primarily on investigating claims of alien origins or a government cover-up of reverse-engineered ET tech. Just because those specific hypotheses were not substantiated does not necessarily mean all UFO/UAP cases have conventional explanations.\n\n2. The report acknowledges that some UFO sightings, especially more recent ones tracked by military assets, do exhibit characteristics that defy current technical knowledge. So there is still an open question around what advanced airborne capabilities, even if man-made, could account for those cases.\n\n3. Absence of evidence is not necessarily evidence of absence. Just because clear proof of extraterrestrial origins was not found so far does not rule it out entirely as a possibility that future evidence could support.\n\nOverall, while being rightly skeptical of outlandish UFO claims, I think a small degree of open-mindedness is warranted on such an inherently complex issue with significant uncertainties remaining. This study represents the current best scientific assessment, but does not have to be the absolute final word.\n\nIf reported UFO/UAP incidents continue to occur exhibiting extraordinary flight capabilities inconsistent with known technologies, that could reopen the need for additional investigation and reconsideration of mundane explanations.

You can find news reports of pilots spotting 'foo fighters' as far back as 1942, and the incidents are similar to modern UAP. The landmark 'Nimitz Tic Tac' from 2004, witnessed by experienced pilot David Fravor, closely resembles reports of 'Cigar Shaped' ufos from the 40s and 50s, and most foo fighters are dead ringers for modern 'Orb' UAP. \n\nI dont doubt that some of what people are seeing is secret military tech.

They can't say \"all\" because they don't know wtf you were looking at, when you claim to have seen something kinda late that one night near that place sometime a few years back.
