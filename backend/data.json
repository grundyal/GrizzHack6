I told him, 'See if the place is suitable as a target or not,' meaning if we can reach it with a missile. We spoke in a secret language, so that no one would spot us.

It's so disgusting they clearly tried to sneak in a revisionist article months after the fact to affect SEO results and have a much more recent thing.\u00a0\n>A new report from Forensic Architecture has disputed Israeli claims that a rocket salvo from Gaza led to the bombing of al-Ahli hospital in October.\n>The report, published on Thursday, disputes two Israeli claims about the strike that killed 100 to 300 people.\u00a0\n>The first Israeli claim is that a misfired rocket from Hamas or Palestinian Islamic Jihad was the reason for the explosion, with the second being that the damage and large number of casualties was caused by unspent rocket propellant.\u00a0\n>Israel referred to footage from Al-Jazeera to back up the claim, with the footage showing an explosion that Israel says caused the rocket to fall and hit the hospital.\u00a0\n>However, the Forensic Architecture investigation reveals that the rocket that was shown exploding was caused by an Israeli interceptor.\u00a0\n>It also reveals that Israel's claim the rocket explosion that caused al-Ahli strike, captured by the footage 8 seconds after the interception, could not have occurred as it would have taken the rocket 31 seconds to fall and reach the ground.\u00a0\n>Regarding the rocket propellant, the investigation determined that all 17 rockets that were fired in salvo that preceded the explosion had expended their fuel propellant whilst the rockets were mid-flight, ruling out the possibility fuel could have caused the extensive damage.\u00a0\n>As well as dismissing Israeli claims, the investigation said that the evidence provided by Israel was part of a disinformation campaign around the source of the explosion.\u00a0\n>Further, the investigation notes that \"Israel has yet to provide any conclusive visual evidence to support the claim that the source of the deadly blast at al-Ahli hospital was a Hamas or PIJ rocket\".\n>Since 7 October, Israel has targeted many of Gaza's medical facilities, with the World Health Organisation reporting by January there had been over 300 attacks on medical infrastructure in the enclave. Israeli forces have also repeatedly besieged and raided medical facilities.\u00a0\n>This includes the al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City which was subjected to an Israeli siege following claims that a major Hamas command centre was underneath the hospital. The claims were not substantiated following the invasion of the hospital.\u00a0\n>Most recently, Israel besieged and targeted the Nasser Medical Complex in Khan Younis, with an Israeli shell striking the hospital's orthopaedic department prior to a raid on the hospital grounds.\u00a0\n>Ravina Shamdasani, the spokesperson for the UN's Human Rights Office, condemned the attack, saying that the raid \"appears to be part of a pattern of attacks by Israeli forces striking essential life-saving civilian infrastructure in Gaza, especially hospitals\".\u00a0\n>Israel's war on Gaza has killed at least 29,092 people and wounded a further 69,028, with aid agencies warning of an urgent danger of famine in the enclave. \u00a0\n\n\nIts the \"newarab.com\" al-ahli article.

A lengthy battle took place, and at the same time dozens of Hamas targets were attacked from the air to allow the force to leave the building with only a minor injury to our forces, who was hit via a fall from a height and via being shot.

But Al-Shifa Hospital has taken on particular significance because it is Gaza\u2019s largest medical facility, and because of Israel\u2019s high-profile claims that Hamas leaders operated a command-and-control center beneath it. Hamas and the hospital\u2019s staff, meanwhile, insisted it was only a medical center.\n\n>**Al-Shifa\u2019s value as a military target was not immediately clear in the days after the Nov. 15 raid, even after the Israeli military released the tunnel video that was used to create the 3-D model seen here.**\n\n>**But evidence examined by The New York Times suggests Hamas used the hospital for cover, stored weapons inside it and maintained a hardened tunnel beneath the complex that was supplied with water, power and air-conditioning.**\n\n>**Classified Israeli intelligence documents, obtained and reviewed by The Times, indicate that the tunnel is at least 700 feet long, twice as long as the military revealed publicly, and that it extends beyond the hospital and likely connects to Hamas\u2019s larger underground network.**\n\n>**According to classified images reviewed by The Times, Israeli soldiers found underground bunkers, living quarters and a room that appeared to be wired for computers and communications equipment along a part of the tunnel beyond the hospital \u2014 chambers that were not visible in the video released by the Israeli military.**\n\n>The Israeli military, however, has struggled to prove that Hamas maintained a command-and-control center under the facility. Critics of the Israeli military say the evidence does not support its early claims, noting that it had distributed material before the raid showing five underground complexes and also had said the tunnel network could be reached from wards inside a hospital building. Israel has publicly revealed the existence of only one tunnel entrance on the grounds of the hospital, at the shack outside its main buildings.\n\n>**The Israeli military says that it moved carefully because the tunnel was booby-trapped and ran out of time to investigate before it destroyed the tunnel and withdrew from the hospital. Israeli and Qatari officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Israel had to leave the hospital to comply with the terms of a temporary ceasefire in late November.**\n\n>**American officials have said their own intelligence backs up the Israeli case, including evidence that Hamas used Al-Shifa to hold at least a few hostages. American intelligence also indicates that Hamas fighters evacuated the complex days before Israeli forces moved into Al-Shifa, destroying documents and electronics as they left.**\n\n>Hospitals are protected under international law, even if they provide medical care for combatants, but their use for other acts that are \u201charmful to the enemy\u201d can make them legitimate targets for military action. But any action must weigh the expected military advantage against the expected harm to civilians.\n\n>Israel launched its war in Gaza after the Hamas-led attack on Oct. 7, in which at least 1,200 people were killed and more than 200 were taken hostage. Since the start of the war, more than 28,000 people have been killed in Gaza, according to health officials there.\n\n>In the face of international opprobrium over its raids on hospitals, Israel has publicized evidence that it says shows that Hamas hid fighters among the ill and injured, and held hostages in the facilities. The Israeli military said that before entering Al-Shifa, it warned the buildings\u2019 occupants, opened evacuation routes and sent Arabic-speaking medical teams along with the soldiers.\n\n>**Hamas and Gazan health officials say the hospitals have served only as medical facilities. But beyond accusing the Israeli military of planting evidence at hospitals, Hamas and Gazan officials have not directly refuted the evidence presented by Israel.**\n\n>The Israeli military said it apprehended dozens of \u201cterror operatives\u201d at Kamal Adwan Hospital in December, and released videos, at the time, of men carrying weapons. A spokesman for the health ministry in Gaza said that Israeli forces had asked the hospital\u2019s administrators to hand over the weapons of its security guards.\n\n>After the raid on the Qatari Hospital, the commonly used name for the Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani Hospital for Rehabilitation and Prosthetics, the Israeli military showed a video on Nov. 5 of what it said was the entrance to \u201ca tunnel that was being used for terror infrastructures\u201d on the hospital\u2019s grounds.\n\n>But the video appears to show something else: a water storage area built in 2016, when the hospital was constructed, according to engineering plans and images from the hospital\u2019s construction reviewed by The Times.\n\n>The Israeli military declined to provide additional imagery to support its assertion that this was a tunnel entryway or part of a tunnel complex.\n\n(1/2)"}, {"id": 361, "question": "How is Reddit responding to the recent news that /r/WorldNews Live Thread for Israel-Hamas War (Thread 46)?", "answer": "Only semi related but I'm still shocked at how many people have essentially become pro SA as long as a \"freedom fighter\" does it.

The terrorist organization Hamas chose to harm Israel strategically in two clear ways \u2013 kidnapping citizens and committing sadistic sexual crimes. Silence is no longer an option. We expect international organizations to take a clear stance; we cannot stand on the sidelines. Silence will be remembered as a historical stain on those who chose to remain silent and deny the sexual crimes committed by Hamas.\"\n\nThe report is the first official research since October 7, consolidating evidence and providing conclusions. The report clearly demonstrates that this is not a \"malfunction\" or isolated incident but a clear operational strategy involving systematic, targeted sexual abuse. The report focuses on sexual and gender-based violence during the massacre of October 7, 2023, and the war that ensued, serving as a primary testimonial foundation indicating widespread sexual crimes. The report was written by, Dr. Carmit Klar Chalamish, head of the research department at the Association of Rape Crisis Centers in Israel, and Noga Berger, director of content at the organization.\n\n*Methodology*\n\nThe report analyzes numerous confidential and public pieces of information, including testimonies, interviews with official and non-official first responders, information permitted for publication in various media outlets, and direct information received by the ARCCI. After gathering the information, a cataloging and analysis process was undertaken to map the areas and patterns of sexual crimes. The report does not provide quantitative information due to the nature of the events, most of which resulted in the victims' deaths, making their full extent unknown and possibly unknowable.\n\n*Findings*\n\nThe report finds that the Hamas attack included brutal acts of violent rape, often involving threats with weapons, specifically directed towards injured women. Many rape incidents occurred collectively, with collaboration among the perpetrating terrorists. In some cases, rape was conducted in front of an audience, such as partners, family, or friends, to increase the pain and humiliation for all present. Some Hamas members pursued victims who escaped the massacre, dragging them by their hair with screams. The majority of victims were subsequently killed during or after the sexual assault.\n\nSeveral testimonies, interviews, and additional sources indicate the use of sadistic practices by Hamas terrorists, aimed at intensifying the humiliation and fear of sexual abuse. Many victims' bodies were found mutilated and bound, with sexual organs brutally attacked, and in some cases, weapons were inserted into them. Some bodies were discovered deliberately booby-trapped. It is essential to note that the report details only information from identified sources permitted for publication, while analysis includes additional confidential information that cannot be disclosed publicly.\n\nAnalysis of the information reveals that sexual and gender-based violence occurred systematically in 4 arenas:\n\nNova Festival (Re'im music festival) \u2013 Testimonies from survivors significantly indicate severe sexual assaults in the festival arena. There are eyewitness and earwitness testimonies of group rape.  These testimonies align with descriptions from first responders and corpse-handling personnel.\n\nKibbutzim \u2013 Testimonies from first responders and corpse-handling personnel reveal signs of sexual assault in the scenes of the massacre. Many cases involve heinous attacks on women and girls, including a case of hiding a knife in a genital organ. Additional information was received by the ARCCI but cannot be disclosed due to privacy concerns.\n\nIDF bases \u2013 Bodies of female soldiers arriving at the \"Shura\" camp exhibited clear signs of sexual violence.\n\nCaptivity \u2013 Information regarding sexual assaults in captivity has been published following the testimonies of those who returned from captivity. These testimonies include various cases, including those of captives who are still alive.\n\nAccording to Dr. Carmit Klar-Chalamish and Noga Berger, the report's authors, \"The brutal practices used on October 7, such as genital mutilation of girls, women, and men, shooting, and weapon insertion, were designed to destroy and inflict sadistic terror. The manner in which these assaults were carried out aimed to reinforce their impact on the victims and their communities, which failed to prevent the harm. As the scars in our hearts refuse to heal, and the souls of our sisters and brothers cry out to us from the depths of the earth, a significant portion of those we considered partners responded in silence and denial of these horrors. We call on you to raise your voices and not allow the cries of these victims to fade away.\""}, {"id": 383, "question": "How is Reddit responding to the recent news that /r/WorldNews Live Thread for Israel-Hamas War (Thread 46)?", "answer": "Bring the hostages home."}, {"id": 384, "question": "How is Reddit responding to the recent news that /r/WorldNews Live Thread for Israel-Hamas War (Thread 46)?", "answer": "Hazinor will publish tonight an interview with the UN official who claims Palestinian women are raped by IDF soldier.\n\nAnyway, they released a small part of it on their Instagram, where she is surprised to hear that Hamas and Hebzollah send rockets into Israel lmao"}, {"id": 385, "question": "How is Reddit responding to the recent news that /r/WorldNews Live Thread for Israel-Hamas War (Thread 46)?", "answer": "BREAKING: House of Representatives passes resolution condemning the Hamas Rapist Regime 418-0-1.\n\nRashida Tlaib was the only present vote.\n\n[Source](https://x.com/israelwarroom/status/1757886573381849319?s=46)."}, {"id": 386, "question": "How is Reddit responding to the recent news that /r/WorldNews Live Thread for Israel-Hamas War (Thread 46)?", "answer": "> Sheba Hospital details the health conditions of the two rescued hostages after 129 days in Gaza\n> \n> https://twitter.com/i24NEWS_EN/status/1756936336739557636"}, {"id": 387, "question": "How is Reddit responding to the recent news that /r/WorldNews Live Thread for Israel-Hamas War (Thread 46)?", "answer": "https://twitter.com/kann_news/status/1757044194118451232?t=ERz98ARCto3iHVS1z-VJyQ&s=19\n\nUAV view of the rescue op, blue are the rescuing force."}, {"id": 388, "question": "How is Reddit responding to the recent news that /r/WorldNews Live Thread for Israel-Hamas War (Thread 46)?", "answer": "From Emanuel Fabian's (Times of Israel) telegram:\n\n> Lockheed Martin Israel, the local division of the US aerospace giant that manufactures the F-35, says it is evaluating the impact of a Dutch court decision ruling that The Netherlands must stop delivering parts for the fighter jets used by Israel.\n> \n> \"We\u2019re working closely with the F-35 Joint Program Office to evaluate the impacts the recent Dutch court ruling will have on our supply chain,\" the company says.\n> \n> \"We stand ready to support the US government and allies as needed,\" it adds."}, {"id": 389, "question": "How is Reddit responding to the recent news that /r/WorldNews Live Thread for Israel-Hamas War (Thread 46)?", "answer": "> BREAKING: An Israeli delegation headed by Mossad director David Barnea will travel to Cairo tomorrow for a meeting with CIA director Burns, Egyptian spy chief Abbas Kamel & Qatar PM To discuss the effort to release the hostages held by Hamas in Gaza, per Israeli official\n>  \n> https://twitter.com/BarakRavid/status/1757150122075455728"}, {"id": 390, "question": "How is Reddit responding to the recent news that /r/WorldNews Live Thread for Israel-Hamas War (Thread 46)?", "answer": "IDF spox confirmed he will show Sinwar's video."}, {"id": 391, "question": "How is Reddit responding to the recent news that /r/WorldNews Live Thread for Israel-Hamas War (Thread 46)?", "answer": "On the Cairo talks (from a couple of articles on Ynet):\n\n* Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu rejected a new outline for the release of hostages, drawn up by Mossad head David Barnea, Shin Bet chief Ronen Bar and Major General Nitzan Alon.

It Has No Precedent | Opinion** [(Newsweek)](https://www.newsweek.com/memo-experts-stop-comparing-israels-war-gaza-anything-it-has-no-precedent-opinion-1868891)\n\n>*By John Spencer\nchair of urban warfare studies at the Modern War Institute (MWI) at West Point; served for 25 years as an infantry soldier and two tours in Iraq*\n\n\n>Israel's war against Hamas in Gaza has inevitably drawn comparisons to other battles or wars, both modern and from the past. These comparisons are mostly used to make the case that Israel's operations in Gaza are the most destructive in history, or the deadliest in history.\n\n>Yet while the use of historical analogy may be tempting for armchair pundits, in the case of Israel's current war, the comparisons are often poorly cited, the data used inaccurate, and crucial context left out. Given the scale and context of an enemy purposely entrenched in densely populated urban areas, as well as the presence of tunnels, hostages, rockets, attackers that follow the laws of war while defenders purposely do not, and proximity between the frontlines and the home front, there is basically no historical comparison for this war.\n\n>**Let's start with the context: After Hamas crossed into Israel on Oct. 7, murdering over 1,200 Israelis in brutal ways that included mutilation and sexual assaults as well as taking over 200 hostages back into Gaza, Israel formally declared a defensive war against Hamas in Gaza in accordance with international law and the United Nations charter.** Since, the IDF estimates it has killed 10,000 Hamas operatives, while Hamas claims that the total number of casualties is 24,000 (Hamas does not distinguish civilian deaths from militant deaths).\n\n>**The truth is that Israel has painstakingly followed the laws of armed conflict and implemented many steps to prevent civilian casualties, despite enormous challenges. Israel's military faced over 30,000 Hamas militants in over 400 miles of defensive and offensive tunnels embedded in and under civilian areas, populations and protected sites such as hospitals, mosques, schools, and United Nations facilities across multiple cities.**\n\n>**Hamas' strategy is to use Palestinian civilians as human shields, because their goal is not to defeat Israel's military or to hold terrain; it is far more sinister and medieval\u2014to use the death and suffering of Palestinian civilians to rally international support to their cause and demand that Israel halt their war.**\n\n>**Meanwhile, Israel's war aims were more traditional: returning Israeli hostages, dismantling Hamas military capability, and securing their border to prevent another October 7 attack.**\n\n>These goals required not one major urban battle but multiple. While Gaza is not the densest populated urban region on earth as many claim, it features over 20 densely-populated cities. And while the Israeli Defense Forces are engaged in fighting, Hamas has continued to launch over 12,000 rockets on nearly every day of the war from the combat area toward civilian-populated areas in Israel, literally over the heads of the attacking IDF, who it bears mentioning are fighting just a few miles from their homeland and the homes of their soldiers.\n\n>**Put all of this together, this war is simply without precedent. Certainly, it cannot be compared to the host of other wars that have been used for comparison sake to paint Israel in an unflattering light.**\n\n>**A battle that does bear a resemblance to Israel's war against Hamas is the 1945 Battle of Manila\u2014the largest urban struggle of World War II, with more civilian casualties incurred than even the Battle of Stalingrad**. The city had a population of 1.1 million residents as well as over 1,000 American prisoners of war being held in the city. It took the U.S. military 35,000 forces and a whole month to defeat 17,000 Japanese Navy defenders in and around the city.\n\n>**Like in Gaza, the defenders used the city's sewer and tunnel systems for offensive and defensive purposes. And there were over 100,000 civilian deaths from the battle\u2014one of the major factors of the 1949 Geneva Conventions, which stipulated the laws of armed conflict to further protect civilians and prevent civilian deaths.**\n\n>**Ultimately, comparisons with both past and modern cases highlight the fact that there is almost no way to defeat an entrenched enemy defender without destruction, even while implementing all feasible precautions and limits on the use of force required by the laws of war.**\n\n>**Let's put away our military history books. There is no comparison to what Israel has faced in Gaza\u2014certainly none by which Israel comes out looking the worse.**"}, {"id": 426, "question": "How is Reddit responding to the recent news that /r/WorldNews Live Thread for Israel-Hamas War (Thread 46)?", "answer": "Gallant's currently holding a press briefing and publicly calling for the Haredim to serve in the IDF.\n\nPretty sure there was some criticism thrown at the coalition members in there... while he's also trying to avoid a direct confrontation with them.\n\nInteresting move on his end."}, {"id": 427, "question": "How is Reddit responding to the recent news that /r/WorldNews Live Thread for Israel-Hamas War (Thread 46)?", "answer": ">**The Shin Bet security agency says it recently foiled an Islamic State-inspired attack by four West Bank Palestinians who manufactured some 100 explosive devices to be used against IDF troops.**\n\n>**The four suspects, arrested last month, are named by the Shin Bet as Murad Markatan, Hasin Markatan, Muhammad Markatan and Ahmed Markatan, all residents of Tarqumiyah near Hebron.**\n\n>The Shin Bet says **the cell prepared some 100 explosive devices using online guides and instructions the head of the cell, Murad Markatan, received from contacting Islamic State operatives abroad.**\n\n>**The cell also had assault rifles and makeshift submachine guns**, the agency says.\n\n>**It says the cell planned to attack IDF troops in the West Bank.**\n\n>The 100 bombs were safely detonated by police sappers, and the other weapons were seized.\n\n>The four have been charged with serious security offenses, the Shin Bet says.

Their lives would be wrecked for treason. Russians donate to charities that located inside Russia though, they\u2019re considered safe and they work with displaced Ukrainians who lost their homes and want to go to EU.\n\nTo understand how bad the situation is, people got into talks with FSB for donating to Navalny in 2014-2018 because in 2021 FSB labeled him extremist. So a donor \u201cfinanced extremism\u201d when it was perfectly legal to do so.\n\nYou need to understand that the Russian punishment services work by KPI. They HAVE TO find a proper amount of losers to punish (thieves, killers, drug dealers, donors to Ukraine), otherwise they themselves would be punished (won\u2019t get a promotion).

But, once the short term crisis was averted, europe went back to chillin\n\nShipping security. Europe imports and exports a lot. Besides China, it's perhaps the most reliant on smooth shipping. The China-Europe route goes through the red sea. The rest goes by other seas. Houthis, the black sea naval war... the game has changed. Europe has no ability to affect this currently, other than asking the US to help. \n\nIran, Armenia, Ukraine, North Africa... these are all at Europe's periphery. Geopolitics is dicey as hell there.

EU must have a policy on Russia-Ukraine. \n\nAll the EU (and dissident state) is threats of brexiting or getting brexitted. That's not a useful toolset.\n\n  \nAlmost all of these big security-adjacent issues are, currently, \"America's problem.\" The US is in charge of things like red sea shipping, Ukraine, Armenia, China and whatnot.

And after that EU countries are going to ask Putin to pay him in advance for his oil and gas and that will be the end of it. Until the next President of USA.\n\nSo the common eu people will still be paying up big time, overpriced gas, oil, food, supplies etc but  they will be like \"welp at least we didnt go to war\"."}, {"id": 2528, "question": "How is Reddit responding to the recent news that Tusk: Time of peace in EU is over, we live in pre-war times?", "answer": "Send your own children dick heads"}, {"id": 2529, "question": "How is Reddit responding to the recent news that Tusk: Time of peace in EU is over, we live in pre-war times?", "answer": "We, as in ALL OF US, all of us glimpsing from what we perceive as the outside looking in; are on the precipice of war in all countries, on all continents.
