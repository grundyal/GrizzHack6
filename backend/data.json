Kids are impulsive. Easy access to guns in the home is horrifically dangerous in these situations - ease of access, familiarity with the method, and lethality of method all increasing suicide rates. The book Children Under Fire goes into this. The author cites a survey of teenagers and young adults who survived suicide attempts which found a quarter of them attempted suicide within five minutes of deciding to, which means if a kid is going for a gun rather than pills, cutting etc they are far more likely to die. \n\nInterestingly, the book also discusses a survey of gun owning families in the rural Southern US which found children knew far more about the guns their parents owned than the parents believed (akin to how parents usually think their kids know far less about sex than they do). In the case of 40% of parents who said their kids don't know where they store their guns, the kids said they knew. Parents believed their children had never handled their guns, the kids said they had. And children educated about gun safety were just as likely to say they'd played with the weapons. \n\nIt's terribly sad to think of kids impulsively ending their own lives with unlocked, loaded firearms on their homes, and gun advocates saying  of suicides in general \"oh well, they would just use some other method\" (not true)."}, {"id": 261, "question": "How is Reddit responding to the recent news that Woman\u2019s feet amputated after boyfriend allegedly shoves her in front of NYC train?", "answer": "The lead is definitely not out of everything. https://apnews.com/article/cinnamon-lead-applesauce-wanabana-fda-344066a22a729d176c0c732180f48247#:~:text=or%20other%20pollution.-,Some%20lead%20in%20spices%20may%20come%20from%20manufacturing%2C%20storage%20or,the%20value%20of%20the%20product."}, {"id": 262, "question": "How is Reddit responding to the recent news that Woman\u2019s feet amputated after boyfriend allegedly shoves her in front of NYC train?", "answer": "I mean this checks out to me.

People (including drunk people) would regularly use it as a walking route between the two. This set of rails ran by two small manufacturer shops, and a scrap yard. As a teenager exploring these areas with friends, we'd often be wandering around after finding holes in the old fences. One time, it was way after hours, and we thought it would be fun to climb up onto the roof of one of those businesses. We dragged a dumpster over to the roof access ladder, and climbed up. When we got up there, there was already someone up there sleeping against once of the roof exhaust vents. Despite us not trying to be very quiet, he never woke up (but did move a couple of times, so we knew he wasn't dead).\n\n  \nHe must have been sneakier about getting up there, because our moving around that dumpster alerted an overnight security guard of our presence, and he called the cops who surrounded the building. They sent an officer up to find and collect us.

My dad had a really bad experience. One day he was driving from one appointment to another over the autobahn. When he got there he couldn\u2019t open the car door. He had to throw his entire bodyweight against the door until it finally opened. When he got out, he saw that his car was completely fucked on the sides.\n\nHe later told us that he had one of those blackouts from the point where he exited a tunnel to where he left the autobahn. That was a distance of several kilometers over a period of 10 to 15 minutes where he was on autopilot.\n\nThen the police got in contact and told him they got  calls from people who where driving behind him, telling them he was swerving across all lanes from the left to the right and back, smashing into the barrier and causing the damage to his car.\n\nI still don\u2019t understand why his license wasn\u2019t taken away right then and there.\n\nI know he went to a doctor and the word epilepsy was said but I\u2018m not sure if he ever got treatment because a couple of years later he totaled his car. Police said he e wasn\u2019t drunk so I suspect it was another blackout.\n\nAnd then another couple of years later I called him in the evening because we had something planed and he casually told me we had to reschedule because he was in a car accident the day before. Wtf dude?! Yes, he totaled another car. But luckily this time he was just completely wasted.\n\nWe\u2018re not on speaking terms because after that I realized he doesn\u2019t even try to change, is a danger to himself and the people around him and I don\u2019t need that in my life. I also cut ties with my grandparents, his parents. 3 weeks after the drunk accident it was his birthday. Their present: Alcohol. I couldn\u2019t believe it.

Evidence was collected from the crime scene. A suspect was brought in, and likely a warrant issued for hair samples. Those hair samples were taken, with ms. Woods doing the testing; comparing the suspects hair samples with the ones found at the crime scene. \n\nHer determination was that the hair matched, indicating the suspect was possibly the perpetrator, and that evidence was submitted to the prosecution to use in court.\nHowever, a secondary investigation (likely commissioned by the defense) found the hair samples found at the scene matched the VICTIM, not the suspect. Ms woods, on being confronted with this information, admitted her ego was bruised. The evidence was thus, properly, disallowed. \n\nHowever, 10 months later, another mysterious sample of hair was compared to the hair at the scene, and found that it DID match the suspect. The issue is there's no record that evidence was actually collected at the scene, thus opening the possibility Ms woods simply took a partial amount of the hair collected from the suspect as a part of the evidenciary subpoena, and tested it against hair collected from the exact same sampling. This then WAS submitted as evidence, used at trial, and used to help convict the suspect.\n\nIn hindsight, it's looking very possible that the evidence was completely & utterly falsified and presented as legitimate evidence of a crime.
